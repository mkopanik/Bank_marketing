# Bank Marketing Dataset
During my journey as a Math student I decided that I should finally try to prepare some data connected projects as I'm also interested in stock market and so on I tried a bit to build some models in this area but it is a bit too challanging for me at the moment so I decided to try prepare a bit simpler project on one of classic dataset. 

## About Dataset
This dataset is related to direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. It includes features like age, job, marital status, education, and the campaign outcome. This might be very helpful in better targeting marketing campaigns. 

## Main Goal 
Creating a classification model to determine whether a given customer will be interested in a deposit or not. At the same time it would be nice to get some patterns and conclusion from client behaviour and their interest in this particular bank offer.

## Exploratory Analysis 
During first part of this project I went throw a lot of charts to get some insights about dataset. To give few examples it semms that management people were way more interested in deposit than blue collar. Interesting thing in this dataset was also the fact that workers with only primary education are better paid than ones with secondary education. 

## Model creation 
I decided for my first project to create relatively simple model that I understand. As signalized earlier I also wanted to have access to feature importance. So I've choosen DecisionTreeClassifier. In final we got relatively good predictor and conclusion which features might influence success of marketing campaign.
